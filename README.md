# Corona Virus(Covid-19) Prediction of confirmed cases and deaths
<p>This is a Polynomial Regression model which is used to predict the confirmed cases and deaths due to Corona virus or COVID-19 in future, upto 21 days.</p>
<p>This model uses Scikit-learn in backend to implement polynomial regression</p>
<p>For this prediction I have used dataset containg countrywise list of confirmed cases and deaths starting from 22-January to 12-August 2020.</p>
